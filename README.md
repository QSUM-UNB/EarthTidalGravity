# EarthTidalGravity
A python wrapper for ETGTAB (Earth Tidal Gravity TABble) - a program to predict Earth tidal gravity accelerations and other tidal components.

ETGTAB computes Earth tide components (tidal potential, acceleration, tilt, displacements, strains, etc.) at any location for time intervals of 5 or 60 minutes. Tidal components can be computed using different tidal potential developments (DOODSON 1921 with 378 waves, CARTWRIGHT-TAYLER-EDDEN 1973 with 505 waves, TAMURA 1987 with 1200 waves, or BUELLESFELD 1985 with 665 waves) for a rigid or elastic Earth.

Note that ETGTAB has been superseeded by PREDICT - a module in the ETERNA software package (version 3.4).
ETGTAB and PREDICT were originally written in FORTRAN by the late Prof. H.-G. Wenzel, Geodetic Institute, Karlsruhe University.
