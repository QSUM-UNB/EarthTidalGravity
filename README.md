# EarthTidalGravity
A python wrapper for ETGTAB - a program to predict Earth tidal gravity accelerations and other tidal components.

ETGTAB has been superseeded by PREDICT - a module in the ETERNA software package.
It allows one to compute the tidal response of an elastic Earth anywhere on its surface.
ETGTAB and PREDICT were originally written in FORTRAN77 by the late Prof. H.-G Wenzel, Geodetic Institute, Karlsruhe University.
